CRNToolkit - Java toolkit for Chemical Reaction Networks
--------------------------------------------------------

CRNToolkit is a small, incomplete Java toolkit for Chemical
Reaction Networks. It contains classes for handling such networks
conveniently.

A Linux-like system and the [eclipse](https://eclipse.org/) environment are recommended!

Examples
--------

Some networks in the examples are not available yet. 

Available networks
------------------

- [BioModels](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels-main/)

- [BiGG](http://bigg.ucsd.edu/)


Requirements
------------

- [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) is mandatory for linear algebra computations!

- [Polco](http://www.csb.ethz.ch/tools/software/polco.html) for EFM computation

- [JSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/JSBML) for parsing SBML-files

- [Singular](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/) (optional but the corresponding methods won't work)
